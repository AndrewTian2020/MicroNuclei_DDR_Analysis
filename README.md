# MicroNuclei_DDR_Analysis
This repository includes the post-processing scripts for the MicroNucML which filters out apoptosis cases as well as distant micronuclei. Additionally there are analysis scripts here which were used to analyze the large DDR screen from Synthego.

The original source code for the actual MicroNuclei detection ML algorithm can be found here: https://github.com/kew6688/MicroNuclei_Detection/tree/main
